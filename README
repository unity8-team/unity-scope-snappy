Snappy Scope
============

The Snappy Scope provides the ability to install and launch snap packages. It
gets the list of available snap packages from the Ubuntu Store, and lets the
user see the details of each application or scope before installing. The details
include screenshots, rating and reviews. It can also be used to launch installed
applications.


Current Status
--------------

The Snappy Scope is under heavy development. Currently, its functionality is
limited to simply listing all snap packages available in the Ubuntu Store.


How to use
----------

Setup up your GOPATH and then:

    $ go get launchpad.net/unity-scope-snappy/snappy-scope
    $ unity-scope-tool $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/unity-scope-snappy/snappy-scope/snappy-scope.ini


External Dependencies
---------------------

The Snappy Scope has a number of dependencies that are not available as .deb
packages. Therefore, in order to facilitate packaging, its dependencies are
vendored using the Vendor tool[1].
