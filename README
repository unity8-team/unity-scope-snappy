Snappy Scope
============

The Snappy Scope provides the ability to install and launch snap packages. It
gets the list of available snap packages from the Ubuntu Store, and lets the
user see the details of each application or scope before installing. The details
include screenshots, rating and reviews. It can also be used to launch installed
applications.


Current Status
--------------

The Snappy Scope is still being developed. Currently, it can do the following:

- List packages available in the store.
- List installed packages.
- Display preview of both in-store and installed packages.
- Install/uninstall packages


How to use
----------

Setup up your GOPATH and then install the Snappy Scope:

    $ go get launchpad.net/unity-scope-snappy/store


Also install the package management dbus daemon:

    $ go get launchpad.net/unity-scope-snappy/progress-daemon


Now run the package management dbus daemon (required for installing/uninstalling
packages):

    $ $GOPATH/bin/progress-daemon


Finally, run the scope itself:

    $ unity-scope-tool $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/unity-scope-snappy/store/store.ini

Note that the information shown in the scope is retrieved from WebDM. By default
the scope will use "http://webdm.local:4200", but you can change that with the
WEBDM_URL environment variable:

    $ WEBDM_URL=http://address:port unity-scope-tool $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/unity-scope-snappy/store/store.ini


External Dependencies
---------------------

The Snappy Scope has a number of dependencies that are not available as .deb
packages. Therefore, in order to facilitate packaging, its dependencies are
vendored using the Vendor tool[1].
